The Mobile Browser can work with an existing website, however it is designed to work with FusionShell, and FusionPro V1/V2 primarily. For Both V1 & V2 the wordpress and joomla directories
Are /web/webroot.com/w and /web/webroot.com/h respectively.

We have included a sample .htaccess which works with both nginx, and apache webservers if copied to the root website location. To test simply use a mobile browser to access your
website and you should be redirected to the V2MobileShell.

1) Run the github script for Version1 or Version2.
2) Install Joomla either manually or via Installatron/Softalicious Installer as instructed from a cPanel account.
3) Install Wordpress either manually or via Installatron/Softalicious Installer as instructed from a cPanel account.
4) Install Drupal either manually or via Installatron/Softalicious Installer as instructed from a cPanel account.
MYSQL COMMANDS
1) create user 'fusionshell@localhost' identified by 'test1';
2) create database fusionshell;
3) grant all on fusionshell.* to 'fusionshell@localhost';

4) Use the wordpress installer noting that joomlatables will be given a different string wp_tablename.
5) Use the joomla installer noting that joomlatables will be given a different string joom_tableablename.
6) Use the drupal installer noting that drupaltables will be given a different string drupal_tablename.

POSTGRES
1) Postgres will work easily with Joomla, but Wordpress requires a special version with a dbfile in the Content directory.
