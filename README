G/A Mobile Browser for FusionShell V1(HTML JAVA ONLY) OR V2(With Opensource Platforms)
November 2020 - Update
John Stritzinger - Sr. Partner - G/a Consulting.

/*--------
FusionV1 - Does not make any Assumptions about BackEnd Databases, or Content Managers. Can Support Any Code Base on any Toolsets and is more flexible than V2 which supports Wordpress 
Drupal And Joomla Hybrid Installations. In Other Words V2 is our recommended approach, but may not be right for everyone. For Custom Clients we start with V1 and use Installatron 
to enhance their environment to any Opensource. If your company has no webrsources you want V2 which is support of WebAutopilot for those with good marketing teams but sparse IT 
resources.
*/////////////

This ADD-ON IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THE BASE V1 PACAKGE.
Requires .HTACCESS off Root to redirect to Mobile Directory
Requires JQUERY Menu System and Support Files
Recommended Existing Content System on Core Web Site
Focuses on Presenting Subset for Full Portal to Customers which can be customized.
Option versus using this tool for FusionShell Customers is to simply load Wordpress as the front page - This Makes Wordpress Summary Data fully avaialable on Greenville Mobile.
